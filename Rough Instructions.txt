Rough Instructions:
- Sorry for the lack of images, I'm doing this very after the fact

***

Materials:
- 3D printer access
- copper foil tape
- conductive paint
	- I used Bare Conductive Paint
	- This can be excluded if you wish to use copper foil, but it looks sleeker with the paint
- clear spray paint
	- I used Rust-Oleum Painter's Touch 2X Ultra Cover Multi-Purpose Paint And Primer in Semi-Gloss Clear
- wiring
	- I used 28 AWG cut to length and manually crimped coming out of the controller - this means one needs crimps and a crimping tool
		- Alternatively, you can use pre-crimped jumper cables for testing
	- I used 30 AWG wiring for the internals
- soldering equipment
	- Soldering iron, solder, flux, fume extraction, alligator clips, etc.
- Hot glue
	- For fixing the internal wiring in place
- breadboard
- Arduino Pro Micro Atmega32U4 
	- 2 of these if you're doing dual control support
- Capacitive Touch Sensors
	- I used Adafruit 12-Key Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout - MPR121
- USB-A to micro-USB cable
	- 2 of these if you're doing dual control support

Flash code to Arduino Micro Controller
- Micro USB to USB-A into your computer
- If using dual control mode, note that there is a Left and Right Ctrl to flash for each one

Print 3D Model
- 5 pieces
	- 2 buttons
	- 1 d-pad
	- 1 body
	- 1 cover

Attach wiring to pieces
- Buttons
	- Adhere a pad of copper foil to the underside of each button
	- Solder 30 AWG wiring to each button, leave about 4 cm of length
- D-Pad
	- Adhere a pad of copper foil to the underside of each of the 4 sections of the D-pad at the tips
	- Solder 30 AWG wiring to each button, leave about 4 cm of length

Create the contact points
- Using either point or extra foil, extend the conductive area from the bottom of the buttons to the top, where they'll be pressed by user
	- For the D-Pad, I have about 1/2 cm over the edge of each section
- Using paint
	- Takes a bit of trial and error, but mix the paint with water to get a thick consistency that will stick to the surface while drying to a smooth texture
	- Once the paint dries, I recommend going over the buttons and the pad with the clear spray paint
		- this drastically helps prevent the paint from rubbing off from constant contact and having to repaint

Wire the pieces to the sensor board
- Feed the wires through the slots of the body
- Solder them to the correct nodes of the Capacitive Touch Sensor
	- up_ = 0;
	- right_ = 1;
	- down_ = 2;
	- left_ = 3;
	- btn1_ = 4;
	- btn2_ = 5;
- Glue the wiring coming out of the controller slots to prevent the buttons and pad from moving outwards

Finish assembling the internals
- Solder 4 x 28 AWG wires to the sensor board at -- VIN, GND, SCL, SDA
	- Helpful to use different colors
	- I use red (VIN), black (GND), yellow (SCL) and blue/green (SDA)
- Feed the wires through the slot of the cover
- Maneuver the internal cabling to minimize sharp bends and gently close and clip the cover with the sensor board inside
	- New versions of the sensor board may have additional connectors on top, it may not fit if you keep them on...

Connect to the micro controller
- Connect the 4 wires to the Arduino micro controller
	- I like to twist the wires to keep them together
	- I also used a breadboard and crimp connections, but you can also solder or connect directly by other means
- Make sure the pin connections are correct
	- VIN (red) to VCC
	- GND (black) to GND
	- SCL (yellow) to Pin2
	- SDA (blue) to Pin3

Connect micro controller to machine
- If using a computer/pc, it should be recognized as a joystick
	- you can use gamepad testers to check if it is recognized
	- https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad
- If using an Xbox Adaptive Controller
	- plug into one of the USB ports, depending on which joystick you wish to control
	- you will then have to go into the controller app and configure the buttons as you wish (recommend A and B)
	- If all D-pad buttons are pressed at the same time (i.e., with your palm), it registers as another button
		- I use this to trigger the home button

Hopefully all works well at this point -- happy gaming!
